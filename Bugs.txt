1. The game just change the player current;y playing during game play but I really havn't 
figured out of what is causing the problem exactly.

2. Apart from  only moving the pieces in the game,also add the GUI way in which
you can also capture an enemy.(obviouly by just moving onto the block,check if its not an
illegal capture,if legal capture,actually iomplement the logic).Add other features as well
...I am talking about winning(checkmate),castling,and all the other important fundamental features.


3. Increase the game size so that it fits the screen.Actually just take advantage of the screen size and 
actuate every dimension based on the PC's internal OS obtained hardware constants.
